I completed my PhD at the Australian National University, Division of Evolution and Ecology, in 2020. Here I worked with Dr. Loeske Kruuk and Dr. Andrew Cockburn. My dissertation investigated the ecological and evolutionary drivers of aging. I started taxonomically broad, conducting a meta-analysis of the early-environment effects on senescence across bird and mammal species, which you can read about [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjM-8XIxbyBAxVwGVkFHS1eCdcQFnoECBcQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fonlinelibrary.wiley.com%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1002%2Fevl3.79&usg=AOvVaw3l4Of6VCUa7ybzqLo4E_9L&opi=89978449){:target="_blank"}. I then focused the rest of my dissertation on understanding inter-individual and intra-individual variation in aging in a single population of Superb Fairy-wrens located in Canberra, Australia. You can read more about that research [here](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/711755){:target="_blank"} and [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jeb.13712){:target="_blank"}.
