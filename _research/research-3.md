I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Guelph (B.Sc. in Environmental Science, Ecology) in 2019. During my studies I spent my summers in the Yukon working as a field technician for the Kluane Red Squirrel Project, and I fell in love with ecological field research. I completed my undergraduate thesis on the links between personality and dispersal behavior, which you can read about [here](https://brill.com/view/journals/beh/154/9-10/article-p939_2.xml?language=en){:target="_blank"}.
