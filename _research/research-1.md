I am currently based at New York University (NYU) where I have held a postdoctoral Researcher Position since 2020 working with the [NYU Primate Reproductive Ecology and Evolution Research Group](https://www.nyuprimatology.com/){:target="_blank"} (led by Dr. James Higham). In this position, I am interested in untangling how aging, the immune system, and social behavior are inter-related to one another in a highly social non-human primate. Field data for this project is collected from the free ranging rhesus macaque population on the island of Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico. You can read about some of the first findings from my research on Cayo Santiago [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2022.1007052/full){:target="_blank"}. This work is on-going, expect some new (exciting!) publications here soon!
