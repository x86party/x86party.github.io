I am an evolutionary ecologist, broadly interested in life-history evolution. My research primarily focuses on understanding the ultimate and proximate drivers of aging and senescence in wild animal populations.

# My Research
**Senescence** is a biological phenomenon characterized by a decline in the functioning of an adult organism as that organism advances in age. Ultimately, senescence leads to declines in fitness-related traits like survival and reproduction. While senescence is virtually ubiquitous across the animal kingdom, within populations there can be considerable variation between individuals in the onset and rate of senescent phenotypes. This suggests that the processes of senescence are malleable to genetics and the environment. In my research, I am interested in understanding how the physical and social environment can explain the remarkable inter-individual variation in senescence rates we observe.
